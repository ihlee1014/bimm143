> Q6: How would you generalize the original code above to work with any set of input
protein structures?

Below is the `analysis` function, which takes in a single protein string as input and outputs a plot of the protein's Bfactor in respect to its residue amount. To use the `analysis` function, pass in a protein name (formatted as "PROTEIN") to the analysis function.

```{r}
# How to use: analysis("PROTEIN")
analysis <- function(protein) {
  library(bio3d)
  s <- read.pdb(protein) 
  s.chainA <- trim.pdb(s, chain="A", elety="CA")
  s.b <- s.chainA$atom$b
  plotb3(s.b, sse=s.chainA, typ="l", ylab="Bfactor")
}
```

Here are some example uses of the `analysis` function.

```{r}
# Example use of analysis function
protein <- "4AKE"
analysis(protein)
```

```{r}
# Example use of analysis function
protein <- "1AKE"
analysis(protein)
```

```{r}
protein <- "1E4Y"
analysis(protein)
```
